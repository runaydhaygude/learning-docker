Built this project to have an hands-on experience with docker. I followed this [introductory course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-docker-for-java-developers/scaffolding-java-applications-with-docker?autoSkip=true&resume=false) instructed by [Mary Ellen Bowman](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/mary-ellen-bowman)
